# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is the first lab of the semster and is meant to act as a refresher from cs 208. In this lab, I was resonsible for writing HTML for an about page with a few required elements such as text, image, and an alert button. I was given created freedom for the style of the page and this was done with CSS. The button itself was meant to have an alert function which was done in the main.js. Also, this lab required a few additional tests to be written. 

## Running the site
Students who choose to run my site are able to fork my public repository. The student can then have a further overview of all componets of the lab if they choose since I feel viewing the lab in an IDE is easier than seeing the componets on GitHub. 

From there, students can view a live preview (with the extentsion) and paste this URL into their broswer: http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html.
